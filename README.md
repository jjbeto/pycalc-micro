# PyCalc - Microservices
A Python calculator project based on my repo [jjbeto/pycalc](https://github.com/jjbeto/pycalc) with specialized microservices to do each operation.

## Motivation
The main idea is to build up more experience in the microservice concepts using a Python environment.The focus of this project is to show up a running microservice environment using API and event-based communication and try to show triggered chain effects in the environment.
